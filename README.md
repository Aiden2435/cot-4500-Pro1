Akin to industry standards, it is required to include a README file per repository. A
README is a file used to describe a repo’s purpose including compilation instructions and
purpose of project. A proper README.md is typically filled out with sections (like an outline
of an essay). However, this will not be required.
For this assignment, a README is required. The amount of information you put
into the README is up to you, but you will need to include the following:
• Mention of requirements.txt
o Since this is part of the structure, you will need to figure out how
to incorporate,
and use requirements.txt (hint: it’s used to install third party libraries in python)
• Mention of running python
o Since we require instructions on to run, you will
need the bare minimum command to run the script.
